I want to make a tool directory with all the latest tools categorised into to different types.
1. We will have a page with list of all the software products
2. We will have list of trending software products
3. We will have list of favourite software products
4. We will have list of new software products
5. Once we click on any software product, we should get a detailed page about the software.
6. We will have an Admin Dashboard, where we will see the list of all the tools in tabular format.
7. In the admin dashboard, I should have a button to add New software product.
8. Also, when i click on any of the software product, i should be able to see the detailed page of the product and able to edit the content.
9. All the data should be stored in database
10. The customer will be able to comment only after logging into the application.
