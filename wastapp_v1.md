# User Journey

1. User when visits the website should be able to search for the app that's already available. it should be automatically shown as the user types the name of the app and user can select it
2. If there's no app already available in database, then the user can enter the name of the app and it should create an a new entry where the user will be asked to enter the website link and click on Create button
3. The application will get the basic details of the app from external sources and display it to user.
4. User can now submit the feedback on why they hate it and then rate their anger level on the product. Writing feedback is mandatory to rate the Anger level.
5. Once the user submits the user can see the App information on the homepage as a Card along with other cards that exist.
6. Each card is basically an Application and submission.
